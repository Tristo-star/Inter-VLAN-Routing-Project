# Inter-VLAN-Routing-Project
The goal of this project was to explore Layer 3 Inter-VLAN routing by configuring VLANs, trunking, SVI interfaces, and routing on Cisco switches in a lab environment. I used Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and implement network configurations, enabling communication between multiple VLANs and verifying network segmentation and routing.
